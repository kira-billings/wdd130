        <p>Hello, my name is Kira Billings. I enjoy new experiences, beautiful scenery, fun times, and food. I have also been advised by the assignment to add more content to this paragraph so I will talk about why I chose my three favorite temples. Number 1 Temple: Ogden temple because it was where I was sealed and I love the shiny gold chandeliers and intricate carving of the marble. Number 2 Temple: is the Red Cliffs temple because of the beautiful natural stone and marble and fantastic artwork. Number 3 Temple is the Las Vegas Nevad Temple because of the symbolism of circle and square and the beautiful whiteness of it all compared to the black roof and how it is a straight road from my work to the temple. Hopefully this is enough text but it is looking okay.</p>

        <p>I live in Utah which has phenomenal beautiful scenery included majestic mountains, desert canyons, alpine
            forests, snowy peaks, and uh-mazing rock formations. Utah is known for many things but the scenery is the
            best.</p>
